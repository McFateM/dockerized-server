# docker-traefik2-host

Generalized Docker server config as documented in [My dockerized-server Config](https://dlad.summittdweller.com/en/posts/042-my-dockerized-server-config/) but modified to use Traefik v2.2.

At last check, 27-Apr-2020, the previous version of this project was used on:

  - https://static.grinnell.edu  <- Grinnell College hosted server
  - https://summittdweller.com   <- Personal DigitalOcean VPS (`digital-ocean-containrrr` branch)
